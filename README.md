# App_TCP_UDP

## What is it ?

In this project, I developed an android application under Java that contains several criteria:

- Application communicating in TCP and UDP
- Use of array, objects and JSON
- Multi-services
- Multi-client

My application uses version 7 of the Android SDK in minimal version.
